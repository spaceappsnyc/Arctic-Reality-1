# Arctic-Reality
SpaceApps project with James Gong
We have used data from the National Snow and Ice Center on the heights of glaciers around the world at different times. We use this along with Spark AR studio to create an augmented reality application where the user can see the arctic circle and its range in height, pick a spot, and view a representative cube of ice from there. They can scroll to see how the glacier height has lowered throughout the years due to climate change.
